It has a landing page which shows you video instructions on how to add ingredients and assign the ingredients to its respective recipe. 
There is also an ingredients page where you can create ingredients providing the ingredients name, quantity and unit. On this page you can also update an ingredient and delete an ingredient.
Additionally there is a recipe page, in which you can create a recipe and assign the ingredients to that recipe. It also allows you to provide a name and a cook time for the recipe.
Lastly users who would like to use this app are given the option to sign up and have user specific data populated from the database. It was designed responsively so devices from phones to monitors can view them.
